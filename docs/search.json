Now that I’m entering a new phase of my life at JHU, here I am once again. I plan to write about the topics that currently occupy my thoughts: math, teaching learning, Lean, programming, philosophy of mind, books, movies, and more…\nFor me, writing serves as a way to clarify my thoughts while staying honest and consistent. As the wise Feynman once said “The first principle is not to fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool.” Expressing your thoughts and putting them out in the world (for nobody to read) is the first step towards that.\nThe title of this post is a meditation prompt by Sam Harris. I’m serious about practicing meditation and mindfulness, but regrettably, not very good at it. Whenever I catch myself doing something I would rather not (like procrastinating writing), I just remind myself to Begin Again.\nSo here’s to not fooling yourself and to new beginnings."

    "text": "I came across this “one sentence” proof that every prime congruent to 1 mod 4 can be written as a sum of two squares:\nhttps://doi.org/10.2307/2323918\nThe proof involves constructing the following cryptic involution \\[\n(x, y, z) \\mapsto \\begin{cases}(x+2 z, z, y-x-z) & \\text { if } x&lt;y-z \\\\ (2 y-x, y, x-y+z) & \\text { if } y-z&lt;x&lt;2 y \\\\ (x-2 y, x-y+z, y) & \\text { if } x&gt;2 y\\end{cases}\n\\] on the set \\(S=\\left\\{(x, y, z) \\in \\mathbb{N}^{3}: x^{2}+4 y z=p\\right\\}\\) and showing that the involution has exactly one fixed point \\((1, 1, k)\\) if and only if \\(p\\) is a prime of the form \\(4k + 1\\).\nThis implies that \\(S\\) contains an odd number of elements and hence every involution of \\(S\\) will have a fixed point. One involution of \\(S\\) is \\((x, y, z) \\mapsto (x, z, y)\\) and a fixed point of this map gives a way of writing \\(p\\) as a sum of two squares.\nThe details do not seem too hard to check (I haven’t checked them though). The real question is - how did the authors come up with this mad involution?"

    "text": "Over the last couple of years, I lived in Chicago and couldn’t go on hikes. The land there is flatter than a pancake. It’s a perfect place for long-distance biking but an extremely boring one for hiking.\nI hiked the Loudon Heights trail at Harper’s Ferry and absolutely loved it. It was a bit tedious at first with no change in scenery - but that’s the whole point of hiking. It’s not about change, or being comfortable, or getting somewhere, but the journey itself. You walk for hours, letting your mind settle down and taking in the beauty of your surroundings. There’s a deep, ancient instinct that kicks in when you find yourself so close to nature. This feeling is hard to describe and equally hard to recollect.\nWhen I hadn’t hiked for so long, I didn’t particularly miss it, but I was also slowly forgetting how much I liked it. It is a precious thing that I hope I don’t lose as I get busy with life."

Some of the classic and dramatic discoveries I read a kid were those of non-Euclidean geometry, Galois theory, the proof of Fermat’s last theorem, as well as Cantor and Gödel’s breakthroughs in logic. However, some of the more commonplace achievements, such as the invention of calculus by Newton and its subsequent formalization a century later through \\(\\epsilon \\delta\\) proofs, also possess a very intriguing narrative that involves not only mathematicians but also philosophers and theologians1.\nI was pleasantly surprised to come across the following resources for learning mathematical concepts through historical sources:\nApparently, these resources are part of an NSF-funded project Transforming Instruction In Undergraduate Mathematics Via Primary Historical Sources TRIUMPHS. I hope I find the time to read through with these materials."

    "text": "We use integers so much in math that it never occurred to me before yesterday that this is a weird word with a weirder symbol associated to it. Wikipedia explains this very nicely.\nThe words integer and entire share the same Latin root: in (“not”) plus tangere (“to touch”). Google says that the first known use of the word integer was in 1571 by Thomas Digges in a book called A Geometrical Practise Named Pantometria. The word origin still doesn’t make complete sense to me but then I don’t know any Latin. The symbol \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) comes from Zahlen, which is German for numbers, and was first used by Hilbert."

Just for fun, I recently tried a Yoga Sculpt class and it kicked my ass.\nThis made me realize two things:\n\nWhen working out alone, it’s easy to not be fully honest with oneself. I probably take longer breaks, get sidetracked by my phone, or choose lighter weights when I could handle heavier ones.\nWe can often push ourselves more than we think. I never knew an hour-long HIIT session with weights, like Yoga Sculpt, was something I could do. I’m surprised I hadn’t tried it earlier.\n\nI once tried a yoga class via livestream, but it didn’t feel the same. The poses might have been identical, but the intensity was different.\nI’ve started to see the benefits of group classes. They push you harder and offer new experiences you might not encounter otherwise."

Of course, the traditional choice for the circle constant is (\\(\\pi\\))—but, as mathematician Bob Palais notes in his delightful article “\\(\\pi\\) is Wrong!”, \\(\\pi\\) is wrong.

Although he’s American, he lives in Italy, making him an immigrant there. He mentioned that being an immigrant is a liberating experience for him, allowing him to see things from a distance, with an outsider’s perspective.\nI’d never considered it, but it rings true for me as well. Being an immigrant in America, I have the unique vantage point to observe the absurdities, joys, and sorrows of this place, but from a distance. Having lived in another country gives me a completely different perspective, knowing how things could be elsewhere. I can never become too myopic here, as I never get too close to things. There is a sad yet liberating quality to it."

As a result of which, my routine has been completely upended, and my habits are in complete disarray.\nI came across this post on Stoicism (something I greatly admire) which, among other things, talks about starting your day right. This made me realize how I’ve been swept up by the unproductive habit of checking my phone first thing in the morning.\nFortunately, I’ve just finished assembling my writing desk by a lovely corner window. My coffee is brewing and my trusty iPad is charged. Time to get back to morning journaling again. Hopefully, even when life gets busy and chaotic, I’ll have the stamina and discipline to keep up with this incredibly useful habit.\n\n\n\nMy writing desk"
