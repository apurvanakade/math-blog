    "text": "I came across this “one sentence” proof that every prime congruent to 1 mod 4 can be written as a sum of two squares:\nhttps://doi.org/10.2307/2323918\nThe proof involves constructing the following cryptic involution \\[\n(x, y, z) \\mapsto \\begin{cases}(x+2 z, z, y-x-z) & \\text { if } x&lt;y-z \\\\ (2 y-x, y, x-y+z) & \\text { if } y-z&lt;x&lt;2 y \\\\ (x-2 y, x-y+z, y) & \\text { if } x&gt;2 y\\end{cases}\n\\] on the set \\(S=\\left\\{(x, y, z) \\in \\mathbb{N}^{3}: x^{2}+4 y z=p\\right\\}\\) and showing that the involution has exactly one fixed point \\((1, 1, k)\\) if and only if \\(p\\) is a prime of the form \\(4k + 1\\).\nThis implies that \\(S\\) contains an odd number of elements and hence every involution of \\(S\\) will have a fixed point. One involution of \\(S\\) is \\((x, y, z) \\mapsto (x, z, y)\\) and a fixed point of this map gives a way of writing \\(p\\) as a sum of two squares.\nThe details do not seem too hard to check (I haven’t checked them though). The real question is - how did the authors come up with this mad involution?"

Some of the classic and dramatic discoveries I read a kid were those of non-Euclidean geometry, Galois theory, the proof of Fermat’s last theorem, as well as Cantor and Gödel’s breakthroughs in logic. However, some of the more commonplace achievements, such as the invention of calculus by Newton and its subsequent formalization a century later through \\(\\epsilon \\delta\\) proofs, also possess a very intriguing narrative that involves not only mathematicians but also philosophers and theologians1.\nI was pleasantly surprised to come across the following resources for learning mathematical concepts through historical sources:\nApparently, these resources are part of an NSF-funded project Transforming Instruction In Undergraduate Mathematics Via Primary Historical Sources TRIUMPHS. I hope I find the time to read through with these materials."

    "text": "We use integers so much in math that it never occurred to me before yesterday that this is a weird word with a weirder symbol associated to it. Wikipedia explains this very nicely.\nThe words integer and entire share the same Latin root: in (“not”) plus tangere (“to touch”). Google says that the first known use of the word integer was in 1571 by Thomas Digges in a book called A Geometrical Practise Named Pantometria. The word origin still doesn’t make complete sense to me but then I don’t know any Latin. The symbol \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) comes from Zahlen, which is German for numbers, and was first used by Hilbert."

    "text": "I came across this video by NumberPhile and 3Blue1Brown about the density of primes that are 1 mod 4 vs the density of primes that are 3 mod 4. The main fact is quite cool but there was something that he said during in the middle of the video that I found more interesting.\nDefine \\(\\chi : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\{-1, 0, 1\\}\\) as \\[\n\\chi(n) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{ if } n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\\\\n-1 & \\text{ if } n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\\\\n0  & \\text{ otherwise. }\n\\end{cases}\n\\] The first interesting fact that I do not know how to prove: \\[\n\\sum \\limits_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\dfrac{\\chi(n)}{n} = \\dfrac{\\pi}{4}.\n\\] Note that the series is only conditionally convergent so the order of summation matters.\nNow modify the above function as follows \\(\\chi' : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}\\) as \\[\n\\chi'(n) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{\\chi(n)}{k} & \\text{ if } n = p^k \\text{ for some prime } p \\\\\n0  & \\text{ otherwise. }\n\\end{cases}\n\\] The even more interesting fact is: \\[\n\\sum \\limits_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\dfrac{\\chi'(n)}{n} = \\ln \\left(\\dfrac{\\pi}{4}\\right).\n\\]\nThere is apparently a similar result about the sums of squares of reciprocals of natural numbers. I’ll phrase a standard result about sums of squares as follows: \\[\n\\sum \\limits_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\dfrac{\\xi(n)}{n} = \\dfrac{\\pi^2}{6}\n\\] where \\(\\xi(n) = 1/n\\). Then modifying the above function in a similar fashion \\[\n\\xi'(n) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{\\xi(n)}{k} & \\text{ if } n = p^k \\text{ for some prime } p \\\\\n0  & \\text{ otherwise. }\n\\end{cases}\n\\] gives us \\[\n\\sum \\limits_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\dfrac{\\xi'(n)}{n} = \\ln \\left(\\dfrac{\\pi^2}{6}\\right).\n\\]\nWhy does this work? What properties do we need the functions \\(\\chi\\) and \\(\\xi\\) to satisfy? Why do the modifications result in logarithms?\nMy guess is that we need to rewrite the series multiplicatively somehow, possibly using primes, take it from there. These series above are of course some of the values of the Riemann Zeta function which we know how to write multiplicatively using primes."

For millennia, the circle has been considered the most perfect of shapes, and the circle constant captures the geometry of the circle in a single number. Of course, the traditional choice for the circle constant is (\\(\\pi\\))—but, as mathematician Bob Palais notes in his delightful article “\\(\\pi\\) is Wrong!”, \\(\\pi\\) is wrong.
