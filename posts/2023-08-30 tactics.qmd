I have always wanted to learn tactics writing in Lean. 
But for whatever reason, none of the tutorials that exist online have been helpful.
I suspect that the best way to learn to write tactics to play around and modify the existing ones.
I came across this short, 4-page tactics tutorial that looks promising. 
I'll give it a go when I get some time.
