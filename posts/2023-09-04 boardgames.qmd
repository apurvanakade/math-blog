I have been trying out some board games groups around Baltimore.
Sadly I could not find any in the city itself but I found quite a few in the surrounding areas.
I have been to two events of far and already learned quite a few new games.

- [Coup](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131357/coup)
- [Wavelength](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/262543/wavelength)
- [Karma](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/158268/karma)
- [Fluxx](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/258/fluxx)
- [Monopoly Deal](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164840/monopoly-deal)

They were all quick games and fun to play. 
If I were to buy any of these then it would be Wavelength. 
All the others were card games and fun to play with people who have never played board games before.
