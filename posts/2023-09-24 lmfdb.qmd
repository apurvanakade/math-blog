> The LMFDB is a database of mathematical objects arising in number theory and arithmetic geometry that illustrates some of the mathematical connections predicted by the Langlands program.

I love this website. I don't understand anything on it. 
But I'm amazed that this exists and I marvel at the amount of effort the writers must have put into making this happen. 
I've always thought that number theory is unique in how it manages to straddle the concrete and the abstract worlds so effortlessly.
This website is a proof of this.
