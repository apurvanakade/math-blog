I like to think that I am generally a very fit person. 
I exercise almost everyday and generally lead an active life. 
Just for fun, I recently tried a Yoga Sculpt class and it kicked my ass. 

This made me realize two things:

1. When working out alone, it's easy to not be fully honest with oneself. I probably take longer breaks, get sidetracked by my phone, or choose lighter weights when I could handle heavier ones.
2. We can often push ourselves more than we think. I never knew an hour-long HIIT session with weights, like Yoga Sculpt, was something I could do. I'm surprised I hadn't tried it earlier.

I once tried a yoga class via livestream, but it didn't feel the same. The poses might have been identical, but the intensity was different.

I've started to see the benefits of group classes. They push you harder and offer new experiences you might not encounter otherwise.
