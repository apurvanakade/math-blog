Came across this really cool short video about identities in a Sudoku square:

It is such a simple identity yet something that I had not noticed myself before.
Makes me wonder what other subset sum identities are there in a Sudoku?
Is this a linear algebra problem? Are we looking for interesting elements in the kernel of some maps?
