I came across this essay by Rodrigo Ochigame exploring possible future impact of math formalization and automation.

[Automated Mathematics and the Reconfiguration of Proof and Labor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11457v1)

Abstract: 

> This essay examines how automation has reconfigured mathematical proof and labor, and what might happen in the future. It discusses practical standards of proof, distinguishes between prominent forms of automation in research, provides critiques of recurring assumptions, and asks how automation might reshape economies of labor and credit.
