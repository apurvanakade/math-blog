It feels as though the director made this movie just for me. I had to be at this point in my life to truly appreciate it. While my life isn't as dramatic as the characters', there is something about the immigrant experience that is so uniquely captured by the film. 

Not too far into the movie, you realize that there cannot be any happy ending here.
Every ending is going to be sorrowful in its own way - and isn't that true about life itself?
Yet you endure with patience, waiting for your chance to cry at an incomplete catharsis.

This could be one of the finest films I've ever watched.
