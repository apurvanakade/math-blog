I was formalizing some linear programming in Lean and came across one of the most surprisingly difficult to prove theorems.

::: {#thm-closed-convex-cones}
<br />

Let $A : \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a linear transformation. Then the set 
$$
\{ A x \: : \: x \ge 0 \}
$$
is closed in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
:::

The naive topological approach doesn't work as this theorem is no longer true if we replace $A$ by an arbitrary continuous map or if we replace $x \ge 0$ by an arbitrary closed set.

This theorem is obviously true if $A$ is invertible. The proof then relies on the fact that 
$$
\{ A x \: : \: x \ge 0 \} = \bigcup_i \{ A_i x \: : \: x \ge 0 \}
$$
where $A_i$ are the submatrices of $A$ formed using the linearly independent columns. This fact itself is surprisingly hard to prove and relies on [Caratheodory's theorem for vectors in a cone](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3759861/caratheodorys-theorem-for-vectors-in-a-cone).
