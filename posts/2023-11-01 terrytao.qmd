Terry Tao posted on [Mastodon](https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/111287749336059662) that he found a bug in a proof in one of [his papers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05328.pdf) thanks to trying to formalize it in Lean.
This is an excellent use case of Lean and tbh the only one that I think is going to be taken seriously for a while.
