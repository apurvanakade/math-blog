I came across two LLM based tactics for Lean

- [llmstep: [L]LM proofstep suggestions in Lean](https://github.com/wellecks/llmstep)
- [LeanInfer: Neural Network Inference in Lean 4](https://github.com/lean-dojo/LeanInfer)

They both use [LeanDojo](2023-09-04 leandojo.qmd) somehow and I don't understand the difference between the two.
Unfortunately, I do not know enough about LLM and AI to tell if this is actually good or just hot gas.
