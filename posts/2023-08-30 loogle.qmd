An improved search engine for Lean: 

- [https://loogle.lean-fro.org/](https://loogle.lean-fro.org/)
- [https://github.com/nomeata/loogle](https://github.com/nomeata/loogle)

I haven't used it yet but it looks promising. 
I personally don't like the search on [mathlib4_docs](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/index.html) and find it very glitchy, slow, and cumbersome. 
Normally, I just use `grep` in VSCode instead, which is better but still very cumbersome and requires a lot of regex jujitsu.
Hopefully this search is better and more useful.
Looking forward to trying it out.
