I came across this "one sentence" proof that every prime congruent to 1 mod 4 can be written as a sum of two squares:

[https://doi.org/10.2307/2323918](https://doi.org/10.2307/2323918)

The proof involves constructing the following cryptic involution 
$$
(x, y, z) \mapsto \begin{cases}(x+2 z, z, y-x-z) & \text { if } x<y-z \\ (2 y-x, y, x-y+z) & \text { if } y-z<x<2 y \\ (x-2 y, x-y+z, y) & \text { if } x>2 y\end{cases}
$$
on the set $S=\left\{(x, y, z) \in \mathbb{N}^{3}: x^{2}+4 y z=p\right\}$  and showing that the involution has exactly one fixed point $(1, 1, k)$ if and only if $p$ is a prime of the form $4k + 1$. 

This implies that $S$ contains an odd number of elements and hence every involution of $S$ will have a fixed point.
One involution of $S$ is $(x, y, z) \mapsto (x, z, y)$ and a fixed point of this map gives a way of writing $p$ as a sum of two squares.

The details do not seem too hard to check (I haven't checked them though).
The real question is - how did the authors come up with this mad involution?
