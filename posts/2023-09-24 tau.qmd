[$\tau$ manifesto](https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto)

> The Tau Manifesto is dedicated to one of the most important numbers in mathematics, perhaps the most important: the circle constant relating the circumference of a circle to its linear dimension. For millennia, the circle has been considered the most perfect of shapes, and the circle constant captures the geometry of the circle in a single number. Of course, the traditional choice for the circle constant is ($\pi$)—but, as mathematician Bob Palais notes in his delightful article “$\pi$ is Wrong!”, $\pi$ is wrong. It’s time to set things right.

Mathematicians have too much time on their hands xD
