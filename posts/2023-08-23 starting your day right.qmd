There is a strong correlation between my daily habits and my level of productivity. 
When I'm at my peak performance, everything feels automated and flowing. 

In the past month, I relocated to Baltimore. 
Prior to that, I was frequently on the move, both for work and family commitments.
As a result of which, my routine has been completely upended, and my habits are in complete disarray.

I came across this [post on Stoicism](https://dailystoic.com/marcus-aurelius-daily-habits/) (something I greatly admire) which, among other things, talks about starting your day right.
This made me realize how I've been swept up by the unproductive habit of checking my phone first thing in the morning.


Fortunately, I've just finished assembling my writing desk by a lovely corner window.
My coffee is brewing and my trusty iPad is charged. 
Time to get back to morning journaling again.
Hopefully, even when life gets busy and chaotic, I'll have the stamina and discipline to keep up with this incredibly useful habit.
