We use integers so much in math that it never occurred to me before yesterday that this is a weird word with a weirder symbol associated to it. 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer#History) explains this very nicely.

The words *integer* and *entire* share the same Latin root: *in* ("not") plus *tangere* ("to touch"). 
Google says that the first known use of the word integer was in **1571** by *Thomas Digges* in a book called *A Geometrical Practise Named Pantometria*.
The word origin still doesn't make complete sense to me but then I don't know any Latin.
The symbol $\mathbb{Z}$ comes from *Zahlen*, which is German for numbers, and was first used by Hilbert.
